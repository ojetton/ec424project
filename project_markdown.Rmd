# Tuning and Training

### Split into Training and Testing Data
```{r training / testing split}
# Set seed before splitting
set.seed(231240)

# Initial 80/20 split for the training/testing data
data_split = data_full %>% initial_split(prop = 0.8)

  # Create training data
train_df = data_split %>% training()

  # Create testing data
test_df = data_split %>% testing()

```

### Create and Tune 4 models on Training data
```{r Creating and Tuning my models}
# ------------------------------ Set up --------------------------------

   # state_code*cooling_days, state_code*heating_days - how different areas of the country
   # demand energy at different levels depending on temperature

# ------------------------ Elasticnet --------------------------------

# DEFINE ELASTICNET MODEL

# ------------------------------ Random Forest --------------------------------


# One more (Logistic Regression?)

```

### Estimate CV Error
```{r}
#  Estimate your error (with an appropriately chosen metric) using cross validation

# Linear Regression Root Mean Square Error
cv_reg %>% collect_metrics()






# Good place to Create figures!!!!
```

# Prediction

### Test on test data
```{r, include = F}
# -------------------- Predicting with Linear Regression ------------------
