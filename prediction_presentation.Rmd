## The Big Picture 

```{r emissions graph, out.width= "65%", out.extra='style="float:right; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/ojett/Documents/EC424/ec424project/project_markdown_files/figure-gfm/Initial_Graphs-1.png")
```

 <font size="4"> 
 **- Question:** How much carbon dioxide will a power plant emit?  
 **- Relevance:** limiting CO2 to combat climate change.  
 **- This is a prediction problem** because it concerns estimating CO2 emissions from a power plant as opposed to the relation between CO2 emissions and other variables.

## Data

```{r gas graph, out.width= "65%", out.extra='style="float:right; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/ojett/Documents/EC424/ec424project/project_markdown_files/figure-gfm/Initial_Graphs-2.png")
```
 <font size="3"> 
 **-** Annual data from 2016 to 2019.
 **-** Sources: *U.S. Energy Information Agency* and  *National Climatic Data Center*.  
 **-** Shortcomings: annual CO2 emission data, heating and cooling days generalized by state region.  
 **-** Data cleaning involved binding multiple dataframes together and renaming variables with long names such as "fuel_consumption_for_useful_thermal_output_mmbtu"

## Methods 

  <div class="columns-2">

**Four methods**  
 1. Linear Regression          
 2. Elasticnet Regression   
 3. Decision Tree   
 4. Boosted Ensemble  
 
 
**Tuning Method**  
 **-** 5-fold Cross Validation  
 **-** Root Mean Square Error  


 </div>  
  
**Tuned Parameters**  
 **-** Elasticnet Regression: *Penalty = 0.01, Mixture = 0.3*  
 **-** Decision Tree: *Cost complexity = 0, tree depth = 10*  
 **-** Boosted Ensemble: *Learning rate = 0.1, tree depth = 8*
 

 
## Outcome

```{r outcome graph, out.width= "65%", out.extra='style="float:right; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/ojett/Documents/EC424/ec424project/project_markdown_files/figure-gfm/Prediction-2.png")
```

 **-** The boosted model performed the best on CV and test data. 
 
 **-** The decision tree was likely overfit to the training data.  
 
 **-** The elasticnet and regression models had similar errors on CV and test data.
